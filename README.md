# DICOM Translator
This Python script is used to move or copy DICOM files from one directory to another, saving each file in a new directory with the patient, exam date and sequence name and Dicom image number.

**For example**, a file named **"IM-0001-0001.dcm"** could be renamed **"John_Doe/20221008_1019/CT_Scan/CT_San_dym_00001.dcm"** if the patient's name is "John Doe", the exam date is 10/08/2022 at 10:19 AM, and the sequence name is "CT_scan".

## Required libraries and Python version
- **Python:** 3.10+
- PyQt6
- tqdm
- pydicom
- ctypes

```basch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage (with Python)
1. Start the script and select the path where the DICOM files are located.

```basch
python DICOMTranslator.py
```

2. Select whether the files should be copied or moved.
3. Select the number of CPU cores to be used for the operation.
4. Click Start Translation to start the operation.

When the process is complete, a message is displayed indicating the duration and the number of files recognized.

## Usage

### Windows:

#### Executable (`.exe`):

1. You can download the DICOMTranslator for Windows using the following links:

   - [Mac Version](/dist/DicomTranslator_mac.zip)

2. Extract the `.zip` file to get the `.app` application.
3. Open the application by double-clicking on `DicomTranslator.app`.
4. Choose if you want the files to be copied or moved.
5. Specify the number of CPU cores to utilize for the operation.
